# AdaptiveBot
The AdaptiveBot repository is to demonstrate how to create and take advantage of adatpive cards. 

There are two ways to send the card that are demonstrated in this code. 
1. C# code to create the card. 
2. JSON card loaded into an object to create the card. 

### Getting Started

To use this code you'll need to install a bot emulator. 
Once you run the code you'll need to connect to the local service that the bot is running on.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install the AdaptiveCard and Bot Connector NuGets to work with a bot using adaptive cards. 
You'll also need an emulator to test and eventually an endpoint to publish it to.

### What it covers
Creating an adaptive card using C# code. 
Loading a previously created card that is written in JSON. 
Using a ShowCard to dynamically change the card the user is seeing without sending additional messages. 
Receiving a response from a card containing information needed to perform a next step.
